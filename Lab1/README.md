Introduction to Librosa

## Learnings
- introduction to  librosa, a Python library for audio processing tasks.
- explored loading and visualizing speech signals using librosa functions.
- Analyzed the relationship between the speech signal plot and spoken content.

## Lab Tasks
1. Speech Recording and Loading: Recorded the phrase "AI in Speech Processing" and loaded it into the Python workspace using
```bash
  librosa.load
```
2. Signal Visualization: Plotted the time-series representation of the speech signal using 
```bash
  librosa.display.waveshow.
```
3. Signal Analysis:
- Observed the signal length and magnitude range from the plot.
- Identified silence intervals from the visual representation.
- Played small segments of the signal to understand its nature.
- Analyzed how abrupt segmentation affects the perception of spoken words.
