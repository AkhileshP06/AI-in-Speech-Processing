Vowel and Consonant Analysis in Speech Spectrograms


## Learnings
- This lab explored the relationship between phoneme categories (vowels, consonants) and their spectral characteristics in speech spectrograms.
- Analyzed the frequency spectrum (using FFT) of isolated vowel and consonant sounds.
- Observed formant patterns in vowel spectrograms and how they differ from consonant spectrograms.
- Investigated spectrogram visualizations to identify transitions between vowels and consonants in speech.

## Lab Tasks
1. Spectral Analysis of Vowels:

- Extracted short segments of your recorded speech containing isolated vowel sounds (e.g., "ah", "ee", "oo").
- Performed FFT on each vowel segment to obtain its frequency spectrum.
- Analyzed the amplitude distribution of the frequency components for each vowel.
- Observed formant frequencies (peaks in the spectrum) and how they differ between vowels.

2. Spectral Analysis of Consonants:

- Extracted short segments containing isolated consonant sounds (e.g., "p", "b", "s", "m").
- Performed FFT on each consonant segment to analyze its frequency spectrum.
- Compared the spectral characteristics of consonants (broader frequency distribution) with vowels (clear formant peaks).

3. Spectral Analysis of Silence and Unvoiced Segments:

- Identified silent portions and unvoiced regions (e.g., fricatives) in your speech signal.
- Extracted short segments from these regions and computed their FFT.
- Observed the low-energy nature of the frequency spectrum for silence and the characteristic patterns for unvoiced sounds.

4. Spectrogram Analysis:

- Generated a spectrogram of my entire recorded speech signal.
- Identified formant transitions (rapid changes in formant frequencies) in the spectrogram, corresponding to vowel-to-consonant and consonant-to-vowel transitions.
- Used the knowledge gained from analyzing isolated phonemes to identify vowel and consonant regions within the spectrogram based on spectral characteristics.
